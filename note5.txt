setters are important in constraining parameter in constructors
	should be used in every constructors
getters(public function to get the variables of a class) are necessary when the private properties are installed
	e.g. public int getAge(){
		return this.age;
		}

when setting properties in a class, set the properties(as variables), set them to private so other class would not mess with the original value.

if variables floating around(not in methods) in class, should always consider setting them as private first, except when there is a very good reason of not doing so

when calling a function with multiple constructors, make sure that the logic function that constriain the parameter input is applied to every contrustor that exists
e.g. this.setName(name);

static should be add to variables in class when they are shared for all instances of class 

when calling static variable, should use the respective class prefix
e.g. Cat.acceptableCoats

when creating two objects, compare: 
1. with ==, compare the memory references
2. with .equal(), compare the value of the objects
